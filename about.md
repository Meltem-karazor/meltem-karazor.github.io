## About

Hi, I am Meltem Karazor, and I am currently a student of Industrial Engineering at Middle East Technical University. Alongside my core studies, I’ve taken several coding and data-related courses. I’m have a solid foundation in Python, R, and MATLAB, and I enjoy applying them to solve real-world problems.

## Why

I want to improve my technical skills and work on larger, real-life projects. I want to turn my passion for data into a career that creates real impact.

## How

I believe Tech Expert Academy provides the hands-on training and mentorship I need to grow faster and reach my goal of becoming a confident data professional.
